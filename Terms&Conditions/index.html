     any copyright or other intellectual property right of mobius or any
     other party whose software, data, proprietary information, patentable 
    invention or other subject matter is included in or required to use your
     App (regardless of whether mobius or such other person licensed, 
    permitted, encouraged or otherwise authorized you to include or use such
     subject matter). You shall not assert any patent right against 
    mobius or any third‑party user based on an alleged infringement that

    created or posted to the Store.</p>
    <p><b>Third‑Party Materials</b>. You represent and warrant that you own

     authentication mechanisms implemented in or by the mobius Products.</p>

     with those requirements.</p>
    <p><b>Warranty to mobius</b>. You represent, warrant and agree that:

    any applicable free or open source software (“<b>FOSS</b>”) used by you;
     (e)&nbsp;the licensing terms for any FOSS included with your App will

     or make available any of the keys, authorization codes, methods, 
    procedures, data, or other information related to the digital signing or
     digital rights management mechanisms utilized as part of the mobius

    any promise, warranty or representation on behalf of mobius with 
    respect to Apps that you post.</p>
    <p><b>Data Collection</b>.&nbsp;You and your Apps may not collect user 
    or device data without prior user consent, and then only to provide a 
    service or function that is directly relevant to the use of your App. 
    You may not use analytics software in your App to collect and send 
    device data to you or a third party. You must provide clear and complete
     information to your customer regarding your collection, use and 
    disclosure of user or device data in advance of and during, that 
    customer’s use. Furthermore, you must take appropriate steps to protect

    reasonably cooperate with such testing, and further you agree that 
    mobius, its agents or contractors conducting the testing shall bear 
    no responsibility for any adverse effects on the operation of your App

            <p><b>Confidentiality</b></p>
    <p>You agree that the configuration and information contained in a 
    Non‑Production Instance, Apps and any information provided to you in 
    connection with a mobius event will be considered and referred to as
     “<b>mobius Confidential Information</b>”). Notwithstanding the 
    foregoing, mobius Confidential Information shall not include: 
    (a)&nbsp;information that is generally and legitimately available to the
     public through no fault or breach of yours; (b) information that is 
    generally made available to the public by us; (c) information that is 
    independently developed by you without the use of any mobius 
    Confidential Information; (d)&nbsp;information that was rightfully 
    obtained from a third party who had the right to transfer or disclose it
     to you without limitation; or (e) any third‑party software and/or 
    documentation provided to you by us and accompanied by licensing terms 
    that do not impose confidentiality obligations on the use or disclosure 
    of such software and/or documentation.</p>
    <p>Unless otherwise expressly agreed or permitted in writing by 
    mobius, you agree not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any 
    mobius Confidential Information to anyone. You agree not to use 
    mobius Confidential Information in any way, including, without 
    limitation, for your own or any third party’s benefit without the prior 
    written approval of an authorized representative of mobius in each 
    instance. You further agree to take reasonable precautions to prevent 
    any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of 
    mobius Confidential Information. You acknowledge that unauthorized 
    disclosure or use of mobius Confidential Information could cause 
    irreparable harm and significant injury to mobius that may be 
    difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, you agree that we will have the 
    right to seek immediate injunctive relief to enforce your obligations 
    under this Agreement in addition to any other rights and remedies we may
     have. If you are required by law, regulation or pursuant to the valid 
    binding order of a court of competent jurisdiction to disclose 
    mobius Confidential Information, you may make such disclosure, but 
    only if you have notified us before making such disclosure and have used
     commercially reasonable efforts to limit the disclosure and to seek 
    confidential, protective treatment of such information. A disclosure 
    pursuant to the previous sentence will not relieve you of your 
    obligations to hold such information as mobius Confidential 
    Information.</p>
    <p><b>Paid Content</b></p>
    <p>Certain parts of the Website may grant you access to certain 
    proprietary content (including, without limitation, training modules, 
    video presentations and audio recordings) that we may make available to 
    you from time to time for a separate fee (“<b>Paid Content</b>”). Paid 
    Content shall be considered mobius Confidential Information, unless 
    otherwise agreed or permitted in writing by mobius. You may not 
    share the Paid Content with anyone, including, without limitation, 
    employees and contractors working for the same entity as you. Subject to
     these terms and conditions, we grant you a non‑exclusive, 
    non‑transferable, personal license to access and use the Paid Content 
    upon your purchase, provided that you may only download one (1) copy of 
    the Paid Content and such download must be completed within the time 
    period specified by us for such download. Except as expressly permitted 
    by us, you shall not modify, translate, reproduce, distribute, or create
     derivative works of the Paid Content or any part thereof. You shall not
     sell, sublicense, rent, lease, loan, assign or otherwise transfer any 
    rights in the Paid Content. We and/or our licensor(s) retain ownership 
    of the Paid Content itself and any copies or portions thereof. The Paid 
    Content is licensed, not sold, to you by us for use only under this 
    Agreement, and we reserve all rights not expressly granted to you. Your 
    rights under this license to use and access the Paid Content will 
    terminate automatically without notice from mobius if you fail to 
    comply with any of these provisions.</p>

    licensors and suppliers harmless from and against any claims,

     claim to the extent that a claim is based on the alleged infringement 
    of intellectual property rights by the mobius Products (independent 
    of your App or other products or services of yours).</p>
    <p><b>Export Restrictions</b></p>
    <p>You may not access, download, use or export materials posted to the

    Development Tools.</p>
    <p><b>U.S. Government Rights</b></p>
    <p>All mobius software is commercial computer software and all services are commercial items. “<b>Commercial computer software</b>” has the meaning set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (“<b>FAR</b>”) 2.101 for civilian agency purchases and the Department of Defense (“<b>DOD</b>”) FAR Supplement (“<b>DFARS</b>”)
     252.227‑7014(a)(1) for defense agency purchases. If the software is 
    licensed or the services are acquired by or on behalf of a civilian 
    agency, We provide the commercial computer software and/or commercial 
    computer software documentation and other technical data subject to the 
    terms of these Terms of Use as required in FAR 12.212 (Computer 
    Software) and FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and their successors. If the 
    software is licensed or the services are acquired by or on behalf of any
     agency within the DOD, we provide the commercial computer software 
    and/or commercial computer software documentation and other technical 
    data subject to the terms of these Terms of Use as specified in DFARS 
    227.7202‑3 and its successors. Only if this is a DOD prime contract or 
    DOD subcontract, the Government acquires additional rights in technical 
    data as set forth in DFARS 252.227‑7015. This U.S. Government Rights 
    clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFARS or other 
    clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer 
    software or technical data.</p>
    <p><b>Waiver and Severability</b></p>
    <p>No waiver of these Terms of Use by us shall be deemed a further or 
    continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or 
    condition, and any failure of ours to assert a right or provision under 
    these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or 
    provision.</p>
    <p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court of 
    competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any 
    reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum 
    extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will 
    continue in full force and effect.</p>
    <p><b>Third Party Beneficiaries</b></p>
    <p>There are no third‑party beneficiaries to these Terms of Use, except 
    that other users of the Website shall be third‑party beneficiaries of 
    provisions of Section 4 (<i>Store and Share</i>) herein in which you 
    promise not to assert claims for breach of warranty, breach of contract,
     patent infringement, or misrepresentation against any third‑party user 
    based on the use or performance of a App.</p>
    <p><b>Classification of Website and mobius Products</b></p>
    <p>In the event of a dispute, the categorization of any subject matter 
    as either the Website or a mobius Product shall be made by 
    mobius in its sole discretion, and mobius may reclassify as a 
    mobius Product subject matter previously included in the Website.</p>
    <p><b>Termination</b></p>
    <p>mobius may terminate these Terms of Use at any time for any 
    reason by giving you written notice, and all licenses, permissions and 
    other rights granted to you hereunder shall immediately terminate 
    (including the license rights granted by third parties under Section 4 (<i>Store and Share</i>)
     herein to permit you to user their Apps).&nbsp; Notwithstanding the 
    termination of these Terms of Use for any reason, Sections 6 (<i>Intellectual Property</i>) and 9 (<i>Legal Considerations</i>) herein shall survive.</p>
    <p><b>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</b></p>
    <p>These Terms of Use and any dispute or claim arising out of, or 
    related to, them, their subject matter or their formation (in each case,
     including non‑contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and 
    construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of 
    California in the United States without giving effect to any choice or 
    conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of California 
    or any other jurisdiction).</p>
    <p>Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of, or related to, 
    these Terms of Use or the Website shall be instituted exclusively in the
     federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of 
    California, in each case located in the Santa Clara, California although
     we retain the right to bring any suit, action or proceeding against you
     for breach of these Terms of Use in your country of residence or any 
    other relevant country. You hereby irrevocably waive any and all 
    objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and 
    to venue in such courts.</p>
    <p><b>Entire Agreement</b></p>
    <p>The Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy constitute the sole and 
    entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Website and 
    supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, 
    representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to 
    the Website.&nbsp; For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms of Use do not
     supersede any Subscription Agreement or other agreement pursuant to 
    which you have been granted the right to use or access a mobius 
    Product, except to the extent that these Terms of Use provide that Apps 
    or other Website Content are not subject to warranty or entitled to 
    support, service credits, refunds, or other service entitlements under a
     Subscription Agreement.</p>
